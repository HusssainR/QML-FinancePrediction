# Quantum-Inspired Finance Similarity Model

This project explores **quantum-inspired approaches to financial similarity**.  
While the current implementation uses **classical machine learning (SVMs, feature encoding, and similarity scoring)**, the broader research connects to **quantum information theory** and how quantum techniques (e.g., entanglement-based similarity, ZZ maps) could enhance financial modeling.
